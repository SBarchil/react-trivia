# react-trivia

This is my try to develop a website like trivianerd.com. I will call it Triviavip.com.
this projects will have two parts :
1- back-end : will be developed using Node js and Mongodb. It will provide the data I will use
for the react part. It will also help me to add data , edit data , and remove it as well.
2- front-end : I will use React to develop it. using the knowldge I rerached so far.
